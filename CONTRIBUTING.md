anything you do for this project will be provided to the public without any strings or conditions

retain no ownership or control after contribution.

## Technical Requirements

All code must:

- Be modern Rust code (currently 2021 edition, latest stable compiler) _or_ GLSL.
- Pass `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` (debug and release) with no warnings
- Support required platforms: Linux, Mac, Windows

### Recommentations

All code should:

- Follow the [guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Provide useful documentation and comments, including private code
- Support other platforms: Android, iOS

## How do I get started

Download the source code and play around with the examples, see README.md for more.

Any and all contributions are acceptable, including major changes to design or capabilities. If your
change is big please ask or open an issue to make sure the rest of the community is on board with
your new ideas.

### What if my idea is too radical

If we cannot fit your change into the existing design without breaking API for other users or
creating other headaches then we will add your code into a `contrib` directory or separate branch as
needed.

## Release checklist

- Run `cargo update` to ensure you have the latest dependencies
- Double-check `cargo clippy --release` and `cargo fmt` _(use `contrib/rel-mgmt/check`)_
- Double-check all examples compile and run as intended _(use `contrib/rel-mgmt/run-all-examples`)_
- Double-check the above on all supported platforms
- Change log: Add a section for the new version
- Change log: Transfer unreleased details to the new version
- Change log: Add diff link (they are at the bottom)
- Run `cargo publish`
- Github: Add a tag for the version
