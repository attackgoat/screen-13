Most code should:

- Create a new file for `struct`'s with non-trait `impl` blocks
- Group all `use` statements into one nested `use` statement; except for visibility modifiers and conditional compilation attributes
- No star-style `use` statements except in demo code which is intended to be concise 
- Prefer alphabetical sorting of code items unless there is a well-known non-alpha context

## How do I get started?

Download the source code and play around with the examples, see README.md for more.

Any and all contributions are acceptable, including major changes to design or capabilities. If your change is big please ask or open an issue to make sure the rest of the community is on board with your new ideas.

### What if my idea is too radical?

If we cannot fit your change into the existing design without breaking API for other users or creating other headaches then we will add your code into a `contrib` directory or separate branch as needed.
