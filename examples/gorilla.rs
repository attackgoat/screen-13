// Gorilla is a game for two players. Your mission is to hit your opponent with the exploding
// banana by varying the angle and power of your throw, taking into account wind speed,
// gravity, and the city skyline. I didn't have gorilla or banana graphics so we have bunnies
// and bullets instead, sorry folks.
