/// This example demonstrates resource aliasing. Aliasing is a memory-efficiency optimization that
/// may be used anywhere resources are leased and used in a render graph. Aliasing allows complex
/// graphs to require fewer individual resources.
///
/// The performance overhead of aliasing is an atomic load for each actively aliased item and one
/// check per active alias to see if it is compatible with the requested resource.
///
/// Acceleration structures, buffers and images may be "aliased" by different parts of any one or
/// more render graphs. The process involves wrapping any pool type (FifoPool, LazyPool, HashPool)
/// in an AliasPool container. AliasPool offers an alias(..) function which operates exactly the
/// same as a regular pool lease(..) except that the result is wrapped in an Arc<>.
///
/// AliasPool derefs to the base pool type and so leasing may be used normally too.
