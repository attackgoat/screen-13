  device will be created and you should use
  `device.physical_device.ray_trace_features.ray_tracing_pipeline` to check for support
- Logical device (`Device`) structure has been moved to `screen_13::driver::device`
- Physical device feature and property structures have been moved to
  `screen_13::driver::physical_device`

  `AsRef<[_]>` and take values of `Copy`-types instead of borrows)
- `ResolverPool` trait has been moved from the `screen_13::graph` module to `screen_13`
