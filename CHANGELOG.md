# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ability to select from available swapchain surface formats when creating an `EventLoop`

### Changed

- Upgraded to spirq v1.0.2

## [0.9.0] - 2023-09-07

### Fixed

- Incorrect handling of images with multiple array layers during render passes
- Validation error related to `VK_KHR_surface` when using headless devices
- Shader modules of graphic pipelines cached by a render pass were not considered during lookup

### Added

- Support for performance profiling crates
- Queue family index is now a part of the API and allows for submission of render graph work using 
  secondary queue families
- Expose all Vulkan 1.0 properties via `PhysicalDevice::features_v1_0`
- `Device::format_properties` and `Device::image_format_properties` so user code may avoid
  calling unsafe `ash` functions
- `RenderGraph::node_device_address` function
- `contrib/screen-13-hot`: Shader compilation macro definition support
- Virtual reality example using OpenXR - see [`examples/vr`](examples/vr/README.md)
- Support for `VK_EXT_index_type_uint8`; use `device.physical_device.index_type_uint8_features.index_type_uint8` to check for support
- Manually configurable image samplers - see [`examples/image_sampler.rs`](examples/image_sampler.rs)

### Changed

- Device creation (and `EventLoop::build()`) no longer take a ray-tracing parameter; instead the
  device will be created and you should use
  `device.physical_device.ray_trace_features.ray_tracing_pipeline` to check for support
- Logical device (`Device`) structure has been moved to `screen_13::driver::device`
- Physical device feature and property structures have been moved to
  `screen_13::driver::physical_device`
- Re-ordered parameters of `RenderGraph` functions: `blit_image_region`, `blit_image_regions`, and
  `update_buffer_offset`
- Updated parameters of `RenderGraph` functions to be more efficient (`Into<Box<[_]>>` is now
  `AsRef<[_]>` and take values of `Copy`-types instead of borrows)
- `ResolverPool` trait has been moved from the `screen_13::graph` module to `screen_13`

### Removed

- `Driver` structure; use `Device::create_headless` directly
- `PhysicalDeviceDescriptorIndexingFeatures` and `FeatureFlags` as they are no longer required

## [0.8.1] - 2023-02-18

### Fixed

- Pipelines which use multiple descriptor sets (different `set =` values) sometimes trigger
  validation errors
- `contrib/screen-13-hot`: build error on Windows platform

### Added

- Custom vertex layout support - see [`examples/vertex_layout.rs`](examples/vertex_layout.rs)
- Enabled full set of Vulkan 1.1 and Vulkan 1.2 core features during device creation
- Ray query support with `ray_omni.rs` example
- Exposed existing command buffer implementation so that programs may wait for render graph GPU
  submissions to finish executing before reading the results with the CPU - see
  [`examples/cpu_readback.rs`](examples/cpu_readback.rs)
- `KeyBuf::is_down` helper function

### Changed

- `contrib/screen-13-egui`: Upgraded to egui v0.20

## [0.8.0] - 2022-12-28

### Added

- Shader hot-reload feature for compute, graphic and ray-trace pipelines (see examples)
- `Buffer` objects may be created with an alignment specified in `BufferInfo` (useful for shader
  binding tables)

### Changed

- `ComputePipeline::create` now takes three arguments: the device, info, and shader
- `ComputePipelineInfo` no longer contains shader information; use `Shader::new_compute` for that
  instead

## [0.7.1] - 2022-12-17

### Fixed

- Soundness issue in `AccelerationStructure::instance_slice` helper function

### Added

- Skeletal mesh animation demonstration in [`examples/skeletal-anim`](examples/skeletal-anim/README.md)

## [0.7.0] - 2022-12-05

### Fixed

- Validation error caused by image blit operations
- `multipass.rs` and other examples use unsupported image formats without checking for fallbacks

### Added

- `EventLoop` may be constructed with multiple hardware queues, see `desired_queue_count` and the
  new `multithread.rs` example

### Changed

- `Resolver::submit()` now takes a queue index instead of an instance; `Device::queue_count`
  provides the total number of queues available

## [0.6.5] - 2022-11-11

### Fixed

- Incorrectly skipped pipeline barriers on resources used in secondary render passes
- Semaphore in-use validation error when dropping swapchain
- Validation error caused by back-to-back image reads in auto-merged fragment shader passes
- Validation error caused by node access for the ALL_COMMANDS stage before graphic passes
- Multiple validation errors in the `example/` and `contrib/` code

### Added

- `bindless.rs` example using an unbounded image sampler array and draw indirect call

### Changed

- Leased resources now reference their pool using `Weak` reference counting to improve drop ordering

## [0.6.4] - 2022-10-31

### Fixed

- Framebuffer resolve functionality was implemented incorrectly, did not work
- Synchronization error when using compute written-resources in fragment shaders
- Validation error in `multipass.rs` example
- Unnecessary depth buffer store operations in `vsm_omni.rs` example

### Added

- Mutlisampled anti-aliasing example (MSAA)
- `attach_color` and `attach_depth_stencil` functions on `PipelinePassRef` when bound to a `GraphicPipeline` for attachments which would otherwise use `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE`
- `node_info` function on `PassRef` and `PipelinePassRef` which may be accessed while recording passes

## [0.6.3] - 2022-10-25

### Fixed

- Panic when setting exclusive fullscreen if the monitor is set to less than maximum resolution
- Panic when overlapping push constant ranges in graphic and ray trace pipelines

### Added

- `bind_node` function on `PassRef` and `PipelinePassRef` which may be accessed while recording passes

## [0.6.0] - 2022-10-06

### Changed

- `clear_color` and `clear_depth_stencil` functions now take the image being cleared: it is now possible to clear and attach, but not store or resolve, an image
- `record_`-* methods now also provide a `Bindings` parameter to the recording closure
- `RayTracePipeline::group_handle` is now an associated function where previously it was a method
- Many types have been moved betwen modules in order to document things cleary

### Removed

- `attach_color` and `attach_depth_stencil` functions: replace with the `load_` and `store_` functions for color or depth/stencil attachments
- `device_api.rs` helper functions: create resources directly
- `run` stand-alone function: Use `EventLoop` directly.
- Various internal-only fields and other types within the `driver` module

### Fixed
