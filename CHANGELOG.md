- `Device::image_format_properties` returns an `Option` so that unsupported formats may return
  `None` instead of relying on user code to detect `DriverError::Unsupported`

  - Constructors no longer return builders
    - Use `to_builder` to convert an info struct into a builder
    - Use `build` to convert a builder into an info struct

- `EventLoop` now produces linear surfaces by default - use `desired_surface_format` and
  `Surface::srgb` to select sRGB
- `Swapchain::present_image` now uses event-based waiting for rendering operations instead of
  polling, greatly reducing CPU usage
- Updated `ash-molten` (_Mac OS support_) to v0.17

### Fixed

- `ComputePipelineInfo::default` now properly sets a default value for `bindless_descriptor_count`

### Removed

- `GraphicPipelineInfo::new` function: Use `Default` implementation instead

## [0.10.0] - 2024-02-09

### Added

- Ray tracing support for `vkCmdTraceRaysIndirectKHR` and dynamic stack size
- Resource aliasing re-introduced - see [`examples/aliasing.rs`](examples/aliasing.rs)

  update strategies:

  - Use associated constructor functions such as `ImageInfo::new_2d(..)`
- `BufferInfo::can_map` renamed to `BufferInfo::mappable`

  creation

### Fixed

- `EventLoop`: Resize swapchain in response to events instead of each frame (_save 50 μs/frame_)

### Removed

- `input`: This module did not support functionality unique to _Screen 13_ and did not have higher
  quality than existing solutions such as
  [`winit_input_helper`](https://crates.io/crates/winit_input_helper)
- `EventLoopBuilder::linear_surface_format`/`srgb_surface_format`: Use `Surface::linear`/`srgb`
  instead

  secondary queue families
- Expose all Vulkan 1.0 properties via `PhysicalDevice::features_v1_0`
- `Device::format_properties` and `Device::image_format_properties` so user code may avoid

- Manually configurable image samplers - see [`examples/image_sampler.rs`](examples/image_sampler.rs)

### Changed

- Device creation (and `EventLoop::build()`) no longer take a ray-tracing parameter; instead the
  device will be created and you should use
  `device.physical_device.ray_trace_features.ray_tracing_pipeline` to check for support
- Logical device (`Device`) structure has been moved to `screen_13::driver::device`
- Physical device feature and property structures have been moved to
  `screen_13::driver::physical_device`
- Re-ordered parameters of `RenderGraph` functions: `blit_image_region`, `blit_image_regions`, and
  `update_buffer_offset`
- Updated parameters of `RenderGraph` functions to be more efficient (`Into<Box<[_]>>` is now
  `AsRef<[_]>` and take values of `Copy`-types instead of borrows)
- `ResolverPool` trait has been moved from the `screen_13::graph` module to `screen_13`

### Removed

  submissions to finish executing before reading the results with the CPU - see
  [`examples/cpu_readback.rs`](examples/cpu_readback.rs)
- `KeyBuf::is_down` helper function

### Changed
