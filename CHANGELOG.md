## [0.6.4] - Unreleased

### Fixed

- Framebuffer resolve functionality was implemented incorrectly, did not work
- Synchronization error when using compute written-resources in fragment shaders
- Validation error in `multipass.rs` example
- Unnecessary depth buffer store operations in `vsm_omni.rs` example

### Added

- Mutlisampled anti-aliasing example (MSAA)
- `attach_color` and `attach_depth_stencil` functions on `PipelinePassRef` when bound to a `GraphicPipeline` for attachments which would otherwise use `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE`
- `node_info` function on `PassRef` and `PipelinePassRef` which may be accessed while recording passes

## [0.6.3] - 2022-10-25

### Fixed

- Panic when setting exclusive fullscreen if the monitor is set to less than maximum resolution
- Panic when overlapping push constant ranges in graphic and ray trace pipelines

### Added

- `bind_node` function on `PassRef` and `PipelinePassRef` which may be accessed while recording passes

### Changed

- Improved fullscreen experience: no extra decoration or briefly display small window
- Cursor re-displayed, if hidden, when event loop window loses focus

## [0.6.2] - 2022-10-20

### Fixed

- Crash/device lost while resizing the window
- Inconsistent frame timing on certain drivers
- Incorrect window size on certain drivers

### Added

- Fullscreen demostration in `vsm_omni` example using F11 and F12 keys
- Configurable frames-in-flight setting

## [0.6.1] - 2022-10-16

### Fixed

- Depth/stencil images are now cleared properly
- Multi-layer framebuffers work as intended
- Render graph resolver orders renderpasses correctly

### Added

- `default_view_info()` helper on `ImageInfo` to assist in defining new views
- Variance shadow mapping example using a filtered cubemap

## [0.6.0] - 2022-10-06

### Changed

- `clear_color` and `clear_depth_stencil` functions now take the image being cleared: it is now possible to clear and attach, but not store or resolve, an image
- `record_`-* methods now also provide a `Bindings` parameter to the recording closure
- `RayTracePipeline::group_handle` is now an associated function where previously it was a method
- Many types have been moved betwen modules in order to document things cleary

### Removed

- `attach_color` and `attach_depth_stencil` functions: replace with the `load_` and `store_` functions for color or depth/stencil attachments
- `device_api.rs` helper functions: create resources directly
- `run` stand-alone function: Use `EventLoop` directly.
- Various internal-only fields and other types within the `driver` module

### Fixed

- Depth/stencil attachment clear requests are properly handled in cases where the image used is transient

## [0.5.0] - 2022-09-17

### Added

- `LazyPool` resource pool which tries to find acceptable resources before creating new ones
- `instance_slice` function for acceleration structures
- `new_blas` and `new_tlas` helper functions for acceleration structure info
- Node-`_mut` functions for `PassRef`: enables clearer code patterns when building passes
- `rt_triangle.rs` example; similar to `triangle.rs` but uses a ray trace pipeline

### Changed

- `build_structure` and `update_structure` now take geometry info as a borrow instead of by value

### Deprecated

- `input::Typing` struct; it has use valid cases but is not within the scope of this crate

### Removed

- `prelude_arc`: Use `prelude` module instead
- `driver::BlendMode::Replace` and other camel-case constants; use screaming-snake versions, i.e. `driver::BlendMode::REPLACE`

### Fixed

- Windows platform: `EventLoop` no longer panics if the window is minimized

## [0.4.2] - 2022-06-28

### Added

- `create_from_slice` function for buffers

## [0.4.1] - 2022-06-24

### Added

- `update_structure` function for acceleration structures
- `group_handle` function for ray trace pipelines

## [0.4.0] - 2022-06-06

_See [#25](https://github.com/attackgoat/screen-13/pull/25) for migration details_

### Added

- Resources may now be bound using `Arc<T>` of `driver` smart pointers: _`Buffer`, `Image`, etc_

### Changed

- Resource state is now held in the `driver` smart pointers instead of the current graph

### Removed

- "Binding" types, such as `ImageBinding` and `ImageLeaseBinding`: _use `Arc<Image>` instead_
- Dependency on the `archery` crate; _see [rationale](https://github.com/attackgoat/screen-13/pull/24)_

## [0.3.2] - 2022-06-01

### Added

- Additional memory mapping functions to `Buffer` structure

### Changed

- `BlendMode` graphic pipeline enumeration is now a structure with full options

## [0.3.1] - 2022-05-27

### Added

- Bindless descriptor support (unsized arrays in shader code) and example

### Fixed

- Improve swapchain image flag handling

## [0.3.0] - 2022-05-20

### Added

- Ray tracing support
- Subpass API, additional examples

### Removed

- Pak file functionality moved to `pak` [crate](https://crates.io/crates/pak)

## 0.2.1 - _Unreleased_

### Added

- Dear ImGui library and example
- Bitmapped text rendering

### Changed

- Pak file baking is now multi-threaded; assets still only get packed exactly once

### Removed

- `CommandChain` structure functionality is now found on the `RenderGraph` structure

## [0.2.0] - 2022-02-08

### Added

- Render Graph module, bindings, nodes, and executions: with render pass merging/re-ordering/etc
- `CommandChain` structure

### Changed

- Lease/pool functionality simplified: leases are now obtained through a common interface using info
- `Engine`/`Program` structures have been merged into a simpler EventLoop structure

### Removed

- _Screen 13_ file-based configuration: use DriverConfig now
- `Gpu` and `Render` structures: use `RenderGraph` and `ImageNode` now

- Implementation of `text` functionality

## 0.1.8 - _Unreleased_

### Added

  platforms and require no bare-metal graphics API knowledge
- "Hello, world!" example using a bitmapped font
