_Screen 13_ is an easy-to-use 2D/3D rendering engine in the spirit of QBasic.

## Overview

Programs made using _Screen 13_ are built as regular executables using an _optional_ design-time
asset baking process. _Screen 13_ provides all asset-baking logic and aims to provide wide support
for texture formats, vertex formats, and other associated data. Baked assets are stored in `.pak`
files.

_Screen 13_ is based on the [_`gfx-rs`_](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx) project, and as such targets
native Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12, OpenGL, WebGL, Android, and iOS targets, among others.

### Goals

_Screen 13_ aims to provide a simple to use, although opinionated, ecosystem of tools and code that
enable very high performance portable graphics programs for developers using the Rust programming
language.

_Just Enough:_ Only core 2D and 3D rendering features are included, along with window event handling
and window-based input. Additional things, such as an entity component system, physics, sound, and
gamepad input must be handled by your code.

## Asset Baking

Asset baking is the process of converting files from their native file formats into a runtime-ready
format that is optimized for both speed and size. Currently _Screen 13_ uses a single file (or
single HTTP/S endpoint) for all runtime assets. Assets are baked from `.toml` files which you can
find examples of in the `examples/content` directory.

## Quick Start

Included are some examples you might find helpful:

- `basic.rs` - Displays 'Hello, World!' on the screen. Please start here.
- `ecs.rs` - Example of integration with a third-party ECS library
  ([_`hecs`_](https://crates.io/crates/hecs), which is _excellent_).
- `headless.rs` - Renders without an operating system window, saves to disk.
- `triangle.rs` - Loads a textured triangle at runtime, with no associated `.pak` file.

Some examples require an associated asset `.pak` file in order to run, so you will need to run the
example like so:

```bash
cargo run --release examples/content/basic.toml
cargo run --release --example basic
```

These commands do the following:

- Build the _Screen 13_ engine (_runtime_) and executable code (_design-time_)
- Bake the assets from `basic.toml` into `basic.pak`
- Runs the `basic` example (Close window to exit)

See the example code for more information, including a helpful
[getting started guide](examples/README.md).

**_NOTE:_** Required development packages and libraries are listed in the _getting started guide_.
All new users should read and understand the guide.

## Roadmap/Status/Notes

This engine is very young and is likely to change as development continues.

- Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.45 _or later_
- _Design-time_ Asset Baking:
  - Animation - **Rotations only**, no scaling, morph targets, or root motion
  - Bitmaps
    - Wide format support: .png, .jpg, _etc..._
    - 1-4 channel support
    - Unpacked using GPU compute hardware at runtime
  - Blobs (raw file byte vectors)
  - Language file (locale to key/value dictionary)
  - Material file
    - Supports metalness/roughness workflow with hardware optimized material data
  - Models - **.gltf** or **.glb** only
    - Requires `POSITION` and `TEXTURE0`
    - Static or skinned
    - Mesh name filtering/renaming/un-naming
  - Scenes
- _Runtime_ Asset `.pak` File:
  - Easy reading of assets
  - Configurable `compression`
    - `snap` is really good
    - `brotli` is amazing, but it has a bug at the moment and fails to read properly
- Rendering:
  - Deferred renderer - **in progress**
  - Forward renderer - **not started**
  - Roadmap:
    - Today: Each graphics operation starts and finishes recording a new gfx-hal command buffer, and
      then submits it
    - Today: All render pass/graphics pipeline/compute pipeline/layouts are hard-coded in the
      `gpu::def` (definition) module
    - Today: Each graphic operation uses the `def` instances and other types to operate the command
      buffer directly
    - Soon: Command buffers will be opened and closed dynamically, lifting ownership of command
      buffers (and queues) up a level
    - Later: Each graphic operation will record what it wants, but all graphic operations before a
      command buffer submit will be grouped
    - Later: Resources currently in `def` will be created at runtime based on the operation graph
    - Later: Render passes will be constructed dynamically as well
    - Later: Gently copy the light binning magic from Granite?
- General:
  - TODO: fonts, models, textures, etc... should be loadable at runtime from regular files

## Optional features

_Screen 13_ puts a lot of functionality behind optional features in order to optimize compile time for
the most common use cases. The following features are available.

_NOTE_: The deferred and forward renderers have separate code paths and you can choose either on a
render-by-render basis.

- **`auto-cull`** *(enabled by default)* — Enables draw call camera frustum culling. TODO.
- **`debug-names`** — Name parameter added to most graphics calls, integrates with your graphics
  debugger.
- **`deferred-3d`** *(enabled by default)* — Ability to draw models and lights using a deferred
  technique. IN PROGRESS.
- **`forward-3d`** *(enabled by default)* — Same as the deferred renderer, but using a forward
  technique. TODO.
- **`multi-monitor`** — Extends the `Screen` trait to support multiple viewports. TODO.
- **`xr`** — Additional types and functions related to augmented and virtual reality. TODO.

## History

As a child I was given access to a computer that had GW-Basic; and later one with QBasic. All of my
favorite programs started with:

```basic
CLS
SCREEN 13
```

These commands cleared the screen of text and setup a 320x200 256-color paletized color video mode.
There were other video modes available, but none of them had the 'magic' of 256 colors.

Additional commands QBasic offered, such as `DRAW`, allowed you to build very simple games
incredibly quickly because you didn't have to grok the enirety of linking and compiling in order get
things done. I think we should have options like this today, and this project aims to allow future
developers to have the same ability to get things done quickly while using modern tools.
