_Screen 13_ is an easy-to-use Vulkan rendering engine in the spirit of
_[QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic)_.

```toml
[dependencies]
screen-13 = "0.3"
```

## Overview

_Screen 13_ provides a high performance [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) driver using smart
pointers. The driver may be created manually for headless rendering or automatically using the
built-in event loop abstraction:

```rust
use screen_13::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), DisplayError> {
    EventLoop::new().build()?.run(|frame| {
        // It's time to do some graphics! ðŸ˜²
    })
}
```

## Usage

_Screen 13_ provides a fully-generic render graph structure for simple and statically
typed access to all the resources used while rendering. The `RenderGraph` structure allows Vulkan
smart pointer resources to be bound as "nodes" which may be used anywhere in a graph. The graph
itself is not tied to swapchain access and may be used to execute general command streams.

Features of the render graph:

 - Compute, graphic, and ray-trace pipelines
 - Automatic Vulkan management (render passes, subpasses, descriptors, pools, _etc._)
 - Automatic render pass scheduling, re-ordering, merging, with resource aliasing
 - Interoperable with exsting Vulkan code

```rust
render_graph
    .begin_pass("Fancy new algorithm for shading a moving character who is actively on fire")
    .bind_pipeline(&gfx_pipeline)
    .read_descriptor(0, some_image)
    .read_descriptor(1, another_image)
    .read_descriptor(3, some_buf)
    .clear_color(0)
    .store_color(0, also_an_image)
    .record_subpass(move |subpass| {
        subpass.push_constants(some_u8_slice);
        subpass.draw(6, 1, 0, 0);
    });
```

## Quick Start

Included are some examples you might find helpful:

- [`hello_world.rs`](examples/hello_world.rs) â€” Displays a window on the screen. Please start here.
- [`triangle.rs`](examples/triangle.rs) â€” Shaders and full setup of index/vertex buffers; < 100 LOC.
- [`shader-toy/`](examples/shader-toy) â€” Recreation of a two-pass shader toy using the original
  shader code.

See the [example code](examples/README.md) for more information, including a helpful
[getting started guide](examples/getting-started.md).

**_NOTE:_** Required development packages and libraries are listed in the _getting started guide_.
All new users should read and understand the guide.

## History

As a child I was given access to a computer that had _GW-Basic_; and later one with _QBasic_. All of
my favorite programs started with:

```basic
CLS
SCREEN 13
```

These commands cleared the screen of text and setup a 320x200 256-color paletized video mode. There
were other video modes available, but none of them had the 'magic' of 256 colors.

Additional commands _QBasic_ offered, such as `DRAW`, allowed you to build simple games quickly
because you didn't have to grok the entirety of compiling and linking. I think we should have
options like this today, and so I started this project to allow future developers to have the
ability to get things done quickly while using modern tools.

### Insipirations

_`Screen 13`_ was built from the learnings and lessons shared by others throughout our community. In
particular, here are some of the repositories I found useful:

 - [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/): A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust
 - [Granite](https://github.com/Themaister/Granite) - Open-source Vulkan renderer
 - [Kajiya](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya) - Experimental real-time global illumination
   renderer made with Rust and Vulkan
